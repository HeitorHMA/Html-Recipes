    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This pizza dough will last for about five days in the fridge. Store it in an airtight storage container or a bowl tightly covered with storage wrap. Allow the refrigerated dough to sit for about 30 minutes at room temperature before using.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)   
        </li>
        <li>
            1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon white sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            2 Â½ cups bread flour
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons olive oil
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon sal
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
        <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
